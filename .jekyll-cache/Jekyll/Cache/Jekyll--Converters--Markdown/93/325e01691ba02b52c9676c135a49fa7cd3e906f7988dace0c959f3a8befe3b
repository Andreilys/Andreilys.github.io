I"Ï<p>Iâ€™m currently living in sunny San Diego, where Iâ€™ve been living for the past few months.</p>

<p>These days Iâ€™m spending my time working as a product data scientist at Apple, focusing on App Store personalization.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m continuing to write on Medium at least once a week, as a way to improve my writing and build an audience.
I also recently finished the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course by fast.ai which really made me excited
about exploring interesting projects in the deep learning space.</p>

<p>My other focuses are improving my meditation/yoga practice and wrapping up my deep dive into Nietzsche/Exisistential philosophy.</p>
