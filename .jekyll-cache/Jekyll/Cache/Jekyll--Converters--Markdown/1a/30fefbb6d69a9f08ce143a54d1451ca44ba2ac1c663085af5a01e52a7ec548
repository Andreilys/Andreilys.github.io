I"_<p>These days I’m spending my time working as a product data scientist at Apple, focusing on App Store personalization. This new role has been a great opportunity to improve my engineering chops, and pick up Scala as a new programming language.</p>

<p>In my free time I’ve been learning piano, rediscovering my love for chess, practicing yoga and exploring alternative methods of meditation.</p>

<p>I also recently moved to San Diego, which has proven to be one of my favorite places to live. It’s not uncommon</p>

<p>Books I’m currently reading include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Robin by Dave Itzkoff</li>
  <li>The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel van der Kolk</li>
  <li>Hyperion by Dan Simmons</li>
  <li>In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Mate</li>
  <li>Impro by Keith Johnstone</li>
  <li>The Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone De Beauvoir</li>
  <li>Fear &amp; Trembling by Kierkeggard</li>
  <li>Chimpanzee Politics by Frans de Waal</li>
  <li>Madness and Civilization by Foucault</li>
  <li>Simulacra and Simulation by Jean Baudrillard</li>
</ul>
