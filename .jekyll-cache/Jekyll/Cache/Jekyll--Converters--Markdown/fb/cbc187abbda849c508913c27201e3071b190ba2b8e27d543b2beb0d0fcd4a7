<p>The easiest way to see what Iâ€™m currently doing is to checkout my <a href="&quot;https://qself-dashboard.herokuapp.com/">personal dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>This month I move to San Francisco to start at Apple as a data scientist on the Media Products team.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m continuing to write on Medium at least once a week, as a way to improve my writing and build an audience.
I also recently finished the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course by fast.ai which really made me excited
about exploring interesting projects in the deep learning space.</p>

<p>My other focuses are improving my meditation/yoga practice and wrapping up my deep dive into Nietzsche/Exisistential philosophy.</p>
