title: What I'm Doing Now

These days most of my time is spent working as a product data scientist at Apple, focusing on App Store personalization. This is a role I transitioned to in August, proving itself to be a great opportunity to improve my engineering chops, and pickup Scala as my main programming language.

Coinciding with transitioning into my new role at Apple, I moved south from Cupertino to San Diego. I can see why people who live in San Diego are so hesitant to leave, as it's quickly become one of my favorite places to live. It's not uncommon for me to go on 2 hour walks along the coastline, listening to the waves, audiobooks and podcasts. 

In my free time I've been continuing to write, learn piano, rediscover my love for chess, practice yoga and explore alternative methods of meditation. 

Books I'm currently reading include:
- Robin by Dave Itzkoff
- The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel van der Kolk
- Hyperion by Dan Simmons
- In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Mate
- Impro by Keith Johnstone
- The Ethics of Ambiguity by Simone De Beauvoir
- Fear & Trembling by Kierkeggard
- Chimpanzee Politics by Frans de Waal
- Madness and Civilization by Foucault
- Simulacra and Simulation by Jean Baudrillard
