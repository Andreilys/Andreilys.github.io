I’m a Senior Data Scientist at Meta within the FinTech organization. Here I'm helping shape the future of subscriptions as a new revenue source for Meta, while building systems that empower creators, foster sustainable growth, and expand the way people exchange value across Meta’s ecosystem.

I’m still obsessed with data-rich product design, especially how we can give builders better instrumentation for subscription health. That curiosity dovetails with exploring how AI-native tooling reshapes incentives inside large platforms and what responsible automation looks like when you’re shepherding people’s livelihoods.

I’m keeping a steady practice of mapping the societal ripples of accelerating AI, from how new capabilities consolidate power to the political turbulence that follows, and I pair that with essays on practical systems thinking for operators.

On the inner work front I’m continuing to write about psychological resilience and spiritual practice. I’m cultivating pronoia, defending our minds from information hazards, and mapping the terrain of love from biological to mystical dimensions.
