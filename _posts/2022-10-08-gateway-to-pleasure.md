Breath the gateway to pleasure,

Inside you is the treasure,

I move through life with leisure,

Measure your life through the hedonic,


Just don’t smoke too much of that chronic,

Sometimes I’m like sonic,

Speed running through this life,

I’m tryin to slow down and be free of strife,



Rife with mental suffering,

My mind is constantly buffering,

Loading yet another thought,

Peace is only brought,


When you step into presence,

It’s our true essence,

All around me the lights glow with luminescence,

We must grow beyond adolescence,


Shed our old identity,

Becoming an embodied entity,

I can’t help but experience serenity,

Density of my pain body has dropped,


Popped into another dimension,

Where there’s no more tension,

Ascension to a higher plane,

I don’t mind the rain,


It’s easy to transmute the pain,

With the help of tantra you can attain,

A beautiful state of being,

And honestly it’s so freeing,


Like taking off a tight shoe,

I only spew,

that which feels true,

This you already knew.
