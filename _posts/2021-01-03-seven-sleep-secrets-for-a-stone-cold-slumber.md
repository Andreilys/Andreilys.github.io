One of the most alarming statistics is that [70% of Americans](https://www.sleephealth.org/sleep-health/the-state-of-sleephealth-in-america/) report insufficient sleep at least one night a month. These sleep deprived individuals then become hazards for others on the road. In a 2010 report, [American Automobile Association](http://www.aaafoundation.org/pdf/2010DrowsyDrivingReport.pdf) estimates that one out of every six (16.5%) deadly traffic accidents, and one out of eight (12.5%) crashes requiring hospitalization of car drivers or passengers is due to drowsy driving.  

The effects of sleep deprivation are also well known and include:

While there have been studies showing that sleep depreviation can help alleviate depressive moods, for example acute sleep deprivation for one night improved mood in about [60% of depressed patients the day after](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181780/), chronic sleep deprivation (or insomnia) tends to be a strong risk factor for subsequent depression.  

There have been several books that have come out in recent years around sleep, the most popular being Why We Sleep by Michael Pollen. While the book has faced some [scrutiny](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/), it does highlight a trend that good sleep hygeine is becoming a key pillar of what it means to be healthy.

With all that said, it's near impossible to come up with a grand narrative for what the "most optimal" sleep looks like. This is partly why Pollen received flack for trying to fit a one-size-fits-all sleep regiment on everyone. Instead a better approach is to conduct [N-of-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118090/) experiments with your sleep,  in order to come to your own conclusions. Yes some things will tend to generalize to the majority of the population (for example avoiding  stimulants 2 hours before bed) but other pieces of actionable advice will be highly specific to the individual.

To that end, before even discussing the strategies I've discovered from years of sleep tracking, I highly recommend starting to track your sleep to get a baseline for what good and bad sleep looks like. If you aren't measuring it, you can't manage it. In my case, I use the [Withings sleep mat](https://www.withings.com/us/en/sleep), a device that fits under my mattress. It tracks a myriad of things such as your heart rate, sleep cycles, respiration rate, and snoring. 

The metric that I look at most frequently is their sleep score, which is a composite metric on a scale from 1 to 100 consisting of:
- Duration (total time spent sleeping)
- Depth (part of night spent in restorative phases, deep sleep and REM sleep)
- Regularity (consistency between your bed- and rise-times)
- Interruptions (time spent awake)
- Time to sleep (time it took to fall asleep)
- Time to get up (time it took to get out of bed)

With their API, I can also look at this data programmatically and weave it into my template for journalling allowing me to quickly review the previous nights sleep.

Once you've set up a system for tracking, whether with a hardware device like the Withings sleep mat, or simply a smart phone app, you can begin testing out various interventions to see if you can improve your sleep. Below I've highlighted seven of the most influential changes that have helped facilitate a consistently high sleep score.

# Treat your bedroom as a sacred sleep sanctuary 

First and foremost you should treat your bedroom as a sacred sleep sanctuary. This means eliminating the use of electronics in the room, or at the very least not using them while in bed.

A key component of any sleep sanctuary is the absence of light and noise. In every bedroom that I've slept in over the last 5 years I've taken great pains to apply [blackout window film](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073FH8RT6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on my bedroom windows so that no light gets in.

Sound-proofing a bedroom starts with identifying the source for the noise. Sometimes it's coming from your door, in which case a [door draft](https://www.amazon.com/Holikme-Stopper-Weather-Stripping-Adjustable/dp/B082W6F8DJ/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=door%2Bdraft%2Bstopper&qid=1609716059&sr=8-5&th=1) can be an effective solution. Other times it's from outside your window, in which case you might want to consider getting soundproof curtains and window inserts. The other potential solution to noise is to simply use white noise, like rain or the sound of a fan to drown out any external noise. 

When I'm travelling, I found that this [sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NZ6FK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [ear plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-Visibility-Disposable-Earplugs-200-Pairs/dp/B0007XJOLG/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=earplugs&qid=1609715950&sr=8-8) have been the most effective for me.  

# Consistent sleep schedule

To figure out what your ideal sleep schedule looks like, go to sleep at the regular time that you do and instead of setting an alarm, see what time you wake up at naturally. After following this exercise try your best to guard the time that you go to bed and come up with some sort of evening ritual that will help facilitate sleep.

In my case, I have withing smart lights which turn to a red at 8pm. This signals to me that it's time to wind down my day, and begin my evening journal entry. Once i'm done journalling, I'll shut down all my electronics and go for a walk. When i come back, I'll spend the remainder of the evening winding down with piano, meditation and reading fiction to get my mind primed and ready for sleep. My biggest blocker to sleep is whenever I focus on issues pertaining to my life. So by inhabiting a fictional world for a few minutes, I find that entering the dream world becomes a lot easier. By 10pm I'll have brushed my teeth and be in bed.

## Use sleep supplements sparingly

The subject of sleep supplements is difficult because on the one hand I can recognize how effective they are at faciliating sleep. Yet at the same time, I recognize the inherent danger of becoming dependent on a supplement that can disrupt your brains natural ability to generate the hormones necessary for sleep.

Personally I use sleep supplements only as a last resort, whether because I've been tossing and turning for an hour, or because I know beforehand that I'll have trouble falling asleep that night (likely because I drank Coffee at 3pm).

The ones that I've found to be the most effective are [melatonin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFSV14/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in small doses like 2.5mg, [magnesium glycinate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RM7VXFV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Hemp Oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NDMRFY3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 

## No Stimulants 9 hours before sleep

The one consistent thing I've noticed in my data is that anytime I drink caffiene after 2pm, I am bound to have difficulty falling asleep and will be forced to take some melatonin. I've also found that I get less deep sleep, often over-sleeping my natural wake up time. 

While this one isn't always easy to follow I try to stick to it as best as I can.

## Be mindful of light

As I mentioned earlier, I have my withings smart lights turn red at 8pm to signal the beginning of my evening routine and minimize my blue light exposure which can suppress melatonin production. I also stop using electronics after 8pm, again to minimize blue light exposure.

At an earlier point in my life I went as far as to wear blue light blocking glasses, but I didn't find them to be more of a nuisance than an aid however your mileage may vary.

## physical activity

While its recommended that you avoid working out close to bed time, it is recommended that you apply some stress to your body throughout the day. Whether it's through running, weight lifting or some other physical activity, the stress from the activity will make it much easier for you to fall asleep.

## don't drink or eat 2 hours before bed

Since interruptions are a key part of the sleep score, we want to minimize the number of times we wake up in the night. Digesting food while trying to sleep is difficult [TK] so I try to have my last meal at least 4 hours before bed. 

Another key thing to avoid is drinking any liquids, particularly alcohol before bed otherwise you're guaranteed to wake up several times in the night.

For the nights that I do wake up needing to use the bathroom, I've resigned to using [this jug](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076S2SLPY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that I keep by my bed to avoid making the round trip to the bathroom and disrupting my sleep.

The topics we covered above should set you well on your way to design your own sleep experiments in your quest to optmize your sleep. Once you've established a good experimental framework for your sleep, eventually you'll settle on something that works for you. If you've had other things help improve your sleep, I'd love for you to share them with me in the comments below.
