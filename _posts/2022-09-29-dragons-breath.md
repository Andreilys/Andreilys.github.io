I feel the dragons breath 

as I experience ego death 

breadth of each stroke is bliss 

hiss in my mind stopped 

\- 

dropped into my core 

I’m hungry for more 

door to my unconscious is open 

hopin somethin new is learned 

\- 

burned logs in the fire 

as my thoughts turned higher 

I’ve reached the summit peak  

now all that’s left is the plummet 

\- 


won it 

what did I win?

i still feel like I’m full of sin 

pin down my arm 

\- 

I no longer feel harm 

alarm in my head is silent 

and the colors are so vibrant 

giant waves washing over my body 

\- 

as I begin to embody 

and enter samadhi 

i experience a paradigm shift 

as I receive this beautiful gift 

\- 

sift through all this childhood trauma 

that continues to play out in my life’s drama 

prana energy exchanged with every touch 

could this be too much?

\- 

clutch onto some sense of reality 

banality of existence melts away 

as we reach the astral plane to play 

pray that I leave the past behind 

\- 

this is all a test that’s designed 

to see how well you can be refined 

molded by the flames 

as we play these infinite games 

\- 

frames are all broken 

nothing needs to be spoken 

token of appreciation for this bodywork 

with some smooth jazz as a perk
