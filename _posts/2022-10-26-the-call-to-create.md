I feel the urge to make 

Life is a cake that we bake

Take this urge to create 

To become great

\- 

Sate this inner hunger 

I ain’t getting any younger 

Always consuming is a blunder 

Sometimes I look around in wonder 

\- 

Everything around you that you call life 

was made up by people no smarter than you.

It’s true 

Few understand this important fact 

\- 

And it makes it hard for them to act 

Anyone can make an impact 

Especially if you attract 

People that have you backed 

\- 

Why don’t you make a pact?

A sacred contract 

With yourself to extract 

As much creative juice as you can 

\- 

I’d rather build than get a tan 

Go west young man 

Settle a new land 
 
Maybe start a cool band 

\- 

Or a castle made outta sand 

Even if nothing goes as planned 

Your life will still be grand 

And food won’t taste as bland 

\- 

A new era is at hand 

Are you ready to take a stand?

Command others with your vision 

No more division 

\- 

If you wanna unify the nation 

You must embody love and creation 

No time for a vacation 

Elation is all I feel in this moment 

\- 

Enjoyment in channeling the divine 

Nothin I make is mine 

It’s because of this higher power that I shine 

Intelligent by design

\- 

No need to get drunk on wine 

All I need is sunshine 

Assign yourself the label of creator 

Nothing will be greater
