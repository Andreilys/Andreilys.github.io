came to this retreat 

to enjoy Sedona’s desert heat

meet my true self

shelf these limiting beliefs

\- 

no more tricks up my sleeves

diseases of the mind 

i’m ready to put ‘em behind

designed to bring us closer

\- 

feels like i got parental closure

exposure to energy work

playin red vs black I feel like a jerk

win at all costs it’s an odd quirk

\- 

doing this with friends is a great perk 

smirk as i think about my past

these moments seem to go by so fast

like tellin stories by the fire, what a blast

\- 

surpassed my expectations 

i feel all of my bodies sensations

temptations to return to an old script

which has me gripped 

\- 

stripped myself of my thinking mind

no longer a man that’s blind

i’ve broken the bind

life doesn’t have to be a grind

\- 

find joy in being awake

especially as the sun begins to break

and my skin begins to bake

take what i’ve learned 

\- 

burned it into my core

i walk through this door

as i begin to explore

no longer keeping score
